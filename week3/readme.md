##Week 3: Interaction: A Clickable Cat

1. Check in/recap from last week. (5 mins)
2. A slideshow/discussion of interesting artwork (20 mins)
3. Brief overview of different types of interaction and how they work (mouse events, data streams, sensors, buttons, trip wires, etc.) (10 mins)
4. Back to Processing! Review the very end of our [first tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/introduction-to-processing/worksheet/) -- the MousePressed function 
Simplify this code so that MousePressed changes the color of the background-- nothing else. If this is super easy for you, challenge yourself to change the color in varying gradients, depending on the duration of MousePressed (make something lovely). (20 minutes)
5. Open Arduino and get the [blink tutorial] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink) (first one from last week) loaded onto your board. (20 minutes)
At this point, you'll be running Processing and Arduino. You'll have an interactive Processing sketch and a blinking LED on the Arduino.
6. Introducing serial communication between Processing and Arduino. Make your light blink with a mouse click (walk through example). (30 minutes) 
7. Get your servo motor and your scuplture/plastic cat working on this program (activate your cat with a click). 

##--You Have Reached Your Goal-- Congratulations!!

From here, you can go in several directions:
* Gloat in your success
* Make a more elaborate moving sculpture (with glue gun and feathers and anything else)
* Go backwards from Arduino to Processing-- as the cat moves, it changes your drawing (practice degrading a photo in interesting ways)
* Work on adding a motion or vibration sensor to activate your cat from the human world.
