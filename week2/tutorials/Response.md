## Responsive drawing in Processing 

Code that responds to input from the mouse, keyboard, and other devices has to run continuously. To make this happen, place the lines that update inside de **draw()** function. The code within the **draw()** block runs from top to botoom, then repeats until you quit the program. 

1. ### Example: The draw() Function

To see how **draw()** works, run this example:

![Draw function](images/drawfunction.png)

You will see the following:
* I'm drawing
* 1
* I'm drawing
* 2
* I'm drawing
* 3
* ...

2. ### The setup() Function
To complement the looping **draw()** function, Processing has a function called **setup()** that runs just once when the program starts
