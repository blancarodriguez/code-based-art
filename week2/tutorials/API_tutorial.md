## Using Twitter's Rest API in your Processing Sketch

*(release info: This tutorial works for Processing 3 and Twitter 4J 4.0.4)*


It's easy to draw with data! All you need to do is follow a few simple steps.

#### 1. Register as a developer with Twitter and gain access to their API
Why do I need to register? Well, it's their data and they want to know who is using it and how. For an incomplete list of APIs that don't require authentication, check here https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2014/04/wanted-simple-apis-without-authentication/.
<br>
What is an API again? Here is a concise overview https://schoolofdata.org/2013/11/18/web-apis-for-non-programmers/.

Ready to use Twitter? First, follow these steps. 

1. Visit https://apps.twitter.com/ and login with your twitter username and password
2. Click on the ‘Create new app’ button at the top right
3. Fill out the form that follows – you can use temporary values (like “Code-Based Art test app”) for the first three fields.
4. Once you’ve agreed to the developer terms, you’ll arrive at the back end of your Twitter app. Note the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret (you will use these in your Processing sketch you log into Twitter)
5. Click the button to generate access token and token secret. Note these down too (or just leave this page open).

#### Week 2:
TECHNICAL: Responsive drawings in Processing.  <br>CONCEPTS: What is interactivity? How can it show us something about ourselves?

#### Week 3: 
TECHNICAL: Beyond the screen/ introducting to basic circuit building and Arduino.  <br>CONCEPTS: How to explore/reveal relationships between humans and machines? 

#### Week 4: 
TECHNICAL: Working with an LED matrix panel.  <br>CONCEPTS: Now we can do a lot of flashy, exciting stuff. How can we use these technologies to illustrate a concept? How can we move beyond the wow factor, and use digital art to ask big questions?

#### Week 5:
Open work day and mini exhibition. Use the skills and ideas we've covered so far to create an original artwork. Invite friends to come in the last hour of class to see what everyone has done. Bring cookies and stuff.
