##Week 2: Physical Computing (aka Coding the Tangible World)

1. Introductions again (new people, check in from last week— show your sketch and remember how you made it). (20 mins)

2. Slideshow/discussion of interesting artwork. Does anyone have any favorite projects in this vein that they want to share? We’ll look them up. (30 minutes)

3. Introduction to Arduino. [Blink tutorial and experiments] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink). (30 minutes)

4. Project 2: Use the [Sweep tutorial] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Sweep) to make something with your servo motor. Use the cat, or make something with wire and feathers, or use the tiny mallets and aluminum pans to make a small instrument.  (60 minutes)

5. Share work and discuss (30 minutes)
