# code-based-art

Hi There! 

Introduction to Code-Based Art is an open workshop in art and technology that I am teaching (in physical form) at Root Division, in San Francisco. 
We'll make a series of projects that explore creative and interesting applications of custom technology. 
Each week has its own focus (overviewed below). Look in the folders for more details, examples and source code. 

####Week 1
TECHNICAL: Introduction to coding in Processing. <br>CONCEPTS: What is a digital self portrait?

####Week 2:
TECHNICAL: Introduction to Arduino/Physical Computing/Electronics.  <br>CONCEPTS: What makes a machine poignant?

####Week 3: 
TECHNICAL: Interactivity or how to build a bridge between physical and virtual worlds (Processing + Arduino).  <br>CONCEPTS: How to explore/reveal relationships between humans and machines? 

####Week 4: 
TECHNICAL: Working with live data/harnessing the Twitter API.  <br>CONCEPTS: A collective self portrait? How can we make data poignant?

####Week 5:
