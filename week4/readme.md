## Week 4: Motion Sensors and Servo Motors

1. Check in and remember what we did last week. (10 mins)
2. A slideshow/discussion of interesting artwork (20 minutes)
3. Introduce the Servo motor- what can we do with this thing? (10 minutes)
4. Hook up the motor and do Sweep tutorial (40 minutes).
  * Use the [Sweep tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Sweep) to make something with your servo motor.
  * Weirdly, there is no code on the Arduino site for that tutorial. But, don't worry! The code exists within your Arduino software! Once your wires are connected, go to File-->Examples-->Servo-->Sweep and open the sketch. 
  * Play with adjusting the movement of your motor.  
5. Break/check: everyone cool? (10 minutes)
7. Add a motion sensor! (1 hour)
 * [Here](https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor/using-a-pir) is a good tutorial to start working with your PIR motion sensor. 
 * [This](http://www.instructables.com/id/Motion-Activated-Servo/) Instructable is also useful to connect your servo to the motion sensor. Instructables are a great resource for Arduino projects! 
8. Talk about the week off and the final class. (30 minutes)
* We have no class on 4/17 because of [Taste](https://www.rootdivision.org/civicrm/event/register?reset=1&id=916), Root Division's big fundraiser that Thursday, 4/20. Come eat and drink and look at art if you're inclined. 
* During the week off, use your Monday night to visit [The Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/), an amazing hacker space on Mission Street at 18th. On Mondays from 7-10pm, they have a free class, Introduction to Circuit Hacking, which is exactly what we're doing! Bring your project and get some advice. Plus, check out their giant LED matrix built from beer bottles.
* Work on a project to finish and share in class on week 5!
