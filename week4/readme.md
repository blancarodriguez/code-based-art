#code-based art

##Week 4: Working with Live Data

1. Share work and ideas from the break. (20 mins)
2. A slideshow/discussion of interesting artwork and an introduction to the concept of an API (30 mins)
3. Register as developers on Twitter and gain access to the Twitter API (10 minutes)
4. Download and install the most recent Twitter library for Processing and import it into the first example sketch (20 minutes)
5. Break/check: everyone cool? (10 minutes)
7. Play with the examples, use Twitter to draw, alter photographs, move the cat, whatever you want. (1 hour)
8. Share work, share code (30 minutes)

Extra bonus idea:
* Try using a sensor to move the cat and send a Tweet!

##Tutorials and Reference Sites for Processing + Twitter
(don't be alarmed if some of these examples don't work right "out of the box". Twitter regularly changes their login processes, so you may need to do some updating/troubleshooting by comparing with our class examples-- still, these have useful information!)
